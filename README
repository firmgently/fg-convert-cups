Hover over converted measurements (highlighted in pink) to see the original text.


### Options

  + change cup measurement from US/Canada/Japan/metric
  + choose what you want to convert (eg. ml --> cups or cups --> ml)


### Overview

  + Focuses more on simplicity than accuracy, keeping to round numbers like 200C rather than 203C (may sometimes be out by a few degrees or ml but should be fine for cooks to use - if the recipe uses cups for measuring exact precision probably isn't essential :) )

  + Converted pages can be printed out.

  + Cups measure by volume rather than weight, which is a very different principle. This addon doesn't change that but should still make usable recipes.
