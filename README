### Convert Cups

Browser extension for Chrome/Firefox/Opera/Safari??

Converts cup measurements on recipe websites to make them easier to follow for people who are used to litres/millilitres.

Also converts oven temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

Just click the pink cup icon to convert units in the current tab.

Options to change cup measurement from US/Canada/Japan/metric.

Focuses more on simplicity than accuracy, may sometimes be out by 5-10ml. The reasoning was to keep it simple, not have awkward numbers and that if you're using cups to measure with you probably aren't aiming for precision :)


## TO DO

Currently only converts in one direction (cups to L/ml, Fahrenheit to Celsius), needs to work in the other direction so eg. US users can convert GB recipes.
