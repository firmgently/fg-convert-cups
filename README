### Options

  + change cup measurement from US/Canada/Japan/metric
  + choose what you want to convert TO (eg. ml/Celsius)


### Overview

  + Focuses more on simplicity than accuracy, keeping to round numbers like 200C rather than 203C (may sometimes be out by a few degrees or ml but should be fine for cooks to use - if you're using cups to measure with you probably aren't aiming for precision :) )

  + Converted pages can be printed out.

  + Cups measure by volume rather than weight. This addon doesn't change that.
